                 TASK 01 - WALKTHROUGH
        Local Network Port & Service Discovery
==========================================================

1. INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------
Think of a local network like a neighborhood. Each house (host/computer) may have doors and windows (ports). Some of these doors may be open and can allow entry (services running). 
The goal of this task was to walk around the "neighborhood" and see which houses had open doors and what was inside.

2. TOOLS USED
----------------------------------------------------------
- Nmap : Like a flashlight that checks which doors are open on each house.
- (Wireshark optional but not used here)

3. STEPS TAKEN
----------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Scanned the whole neighborhood (network) to see which houses were present.

Step 2: Checked each house to see which doors (ports) were open.

Step 3: Looked closer to identify what kind of room or service was behind each door (e.g. Database, File Sharing, DNS).

Step 4: Wrote down which houses were safe and which had risky open doors.

4. WHAT WAS FOUND
----------------------------------------------------------
House 1: 
- One door open (DNS service).
- Not too risky if updated, but still needs checking.

House 2:
- Multiple important doors open (SMB, RPC, MySQL Database).
- This is dangerous because strangers could misuse them.
- Highest risk house.

House 3:
- All doors shut (no entry possible).
- Safe.

House 4:
- All doors shut (no entry possible).
- Safe.

5. RISKS
----------------------------------------------------------
- The second house (Windows computer) had too many important doors open. This could let attackers steal data or control the system.
- The first house (Linux server running DNS) was not too bad, but if outdated, it could still cause issues.
- Other houses were safe.

6. FIXES (REMEDIATION)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Close unnecessary doors (restrict services like SMB, RPC).
- Update the systems to latest patches.
- Lock down the database so only trusted people can enter.
- Improve fences (firewalls) and install cameras (monitoring).
- Keep everything updated regularly.

7. CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------------------------
This task was like a safety inspection in a digital neighborhood. Out of four houses:
- One house had serious problems (critical risk).
- One house had some possible problems (medium risk).
- Two houses were safe.

Immediate repairs were suggested for the risky houses to keep the neighborhood secure.
